      <h1>Need</h1>
      <p>
        Freelancers are not supported like employees of a company, their income is entirely dependent on whether they can find clients willing to pay for their services and or products. This instability hinders a young freelancers ability to functioning within society. Further more, as a freelancers income is so heavily dependent on clients, performing lower paying work to communities is often not economically viable.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>What Deco does</h1>
      <p>
        Deco is a non for profit charity aimed at improving the lives of young freelancers. Deco will provide a steady income to the individuals it supports by distributing income, providing jobs, and funding community projects.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>How does Deco’s income support function</h1>
      <p>
        Deco requires the cooperation with the individuals it supports. Individuals must use Deco’s invoice system to collect payments from clients. The three transaction modes are:
        - An individual bills the client, then donates a portion (if applicable) to Deco (either through direct debit or bank transfer as charity donations).
        - Both the individual (as income) and Deco (as charity donations) bill the client.
        - Deco bills the client (as charity donations).
        Deco then algorithmically distributes its income and returns it back to the individuals it supports (as charity benefits).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>Deco Jobs</h1>
      <p>
        Is a portal that allows freelancers to browse for available work and offer work (when they are already working or different skills are required). Jobs will be maintained by Deco’s members (admin).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>Deco Portfolios</h1>
      <p>
        Is a web portfolio template that individuals can use to showcase their skills and previous projects to the public. All portfolios can also accessed through a central page publicised by Deco.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Deco Accounts</h1>
        <p>
          Is a portal for Deco members to monitor the financial position of Deco. Accounts will use a majority approval system to ensure that any decision is approved by the board. This will also prevent malicious attacks to sensitive information and miss use of the ATO and bank account controlled by Deco’s server.
